# Bomberman in Node.js

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=Node.js)

My attempt at implementing the bomberman game using Node.js. I was new to Node.js by the time I made this. This project was a "practice project" to learn Node.js.

To play the game run <code>node nodePrac.js</code>, then in the URL type "localhost:8080/bomberman". This is a multiplier game, so you will need another player who would connect to your computer.
